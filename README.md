## Compile the code

```sh
$ make clean
$ make
```
It generates an executable "ged".

## Run the code
Make sure the dataset folder and the data text file has the same name. Along with that we need to have all_graph_file.txt which has all graph pairs along with their similarity threshold.

You can run the code by
$ ./ged dataset_name
